# Kubernetes Clusters

The clusters can be automatically installed on top of Jelastic PaaS in two ways:

* **Clean** cluster with pre-deployed HelloWorld example
* **Custom** helm or stack deployment via shell command

Also, there are different topologies available out-of-box:
* **Development** - one control-plane (1) and one scalable worker (1+)
* **Production** - multi control-plane (3) with API balancers (2+) and scalable workers (2+)

The number of worker nodes can be changed after the initial installation is completed. All the newly added nodes are automatically connected to the cluster.

## Cloud Native Applications

Easily containerize and migrate existing applications, run hyper scalable microservices and keep them resilient to failures, get extra savings due to more efficient resource utilization, implement CI/CD automation and develop at a higher level of speed in shorter release cycles. 

Jelastic PaaS functionality allows to provision the clusters across multiple clouds and on-premises with no vendor lock-in, automatically scale them vertically and horizontally, start from one instance and grow up to thousands, manage the workloads via intuitive UI, as well as automate the DevOps processes with open API and Cloud Scripting.
